# LLM for Sentiment Analysis with 4-bit Quantization and LoRA

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a Large Language Model (LLM) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and 4-bit quantization to perform sentiment analysis on user reviews. It uses the Mistral-7B-Instruct model while optimizing memory efficiency using quantization-aware training.

---

## Project Overview

Large language models are powerful but resource-intensive. This project explores how to make them more efficient using quantization and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. With a lightweight setup, the model is fine-tuned to classify textual reviews into sentiments such as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

---

## Objectives

- Fine-tune a pre-trained LLM on a sentiment analysis task  
- Use LoRA to reduce the number of trainable parameters  
- Enable 4-bit quantization to optimize memory and speed  
- Demonstrate simple inference on review-style inputs  

---

## Tech Stack

- **Model**: [Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1)  
- **Libraries**: `transformers`, `datasets`, `peft`, `bitsandbytes`, `accelerate`  
- **Quantization**: 4-bit using BitsAndBytes (NF4 format)  
- **Fine-tuning Method**: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)  

---

## Dataset

The project uses a small toy dataset of manually written customer reviews, each labeled with a sentiment. The format is:

**Review**: `<text>`  
**Sentiment**: `<label>`

Examples:

- Review: I love this product! Sentiment: Positive  
- Review: This is the worst purchase I've made. Sentiment: Negative

## Features

- 4-bit quantized model loading to reduce memory usage  
- LoRA-based training for efficiency  
- Simple dataset for fast experimentation  
- Inference function to classify review sentiment  

---

## Expected Outcomes

- Learn how to fine-tune LLMs efficiently using LoRA and quantization  
- Train a lightweight sentiment analysis model  
- Reuse or deploy the model for similar NLP tasks

## Important Notes

- You need a Hugging Face account and token to use the pre-trained model  
- Make sure your environment has GPU support (e.g., NVIDIA T4 or better)  
- This example uses a toy dataset — consider using a real dataset for production  

---

## Next Steps

- Replace the toy dataset with IMDb, Amazon, or Yelp reviews  
- Package the model into a web API using FastAPI or Gradio  
- Extend the classifier to support multi-class or aspect-based sentiment analysis
